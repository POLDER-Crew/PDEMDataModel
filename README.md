# Polar Data Ecosystem Mapping

## Background
This repository contains the data model for the Polar Data Ecosystem Mapping exc
ercise, initially called the Arctic Data Ecosystem Mapping which started during the first meeting of the Arctic Data Committee in November of 2014.  

Initially all data related to the POLDER component of the project was included in spreadsheets, but this information has been transferred into a graph and is supported by the application Mapping the Polar Data Ecosystem (MPDE) application.

## How to build the PDF and HTML
ASCIIDOC documents can be converted into other formats using asciidoctor. This is available for both Linux and Windows environments. In order to create a PDF document asciidoctor-pdf is used. The Makefile in this repository will perform the conversion of the ASCIIDOC code to a PDF document provided you have access to asciidoctor.
